Observations on WeatherPy

Both Northern hemisphere and southern show a high r-value which indicates that the max temperature increases  as latitude gets near zero. Indicating a positive correlation.
The r-value is relatively low, showing a negative correlation. Latitude does not seem to impact humidity.
Cloudiness does not show any change with latitude. r-values are relatively low, so no correlation between the 2.
Wind speed does not seem to change with latitude. Both r-values are relatively low, so no correlation between the 2 factors.
